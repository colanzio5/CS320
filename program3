				Program 3
				  CS 320

Reread the Policy statement at the beginning of the class notes; you MUST
do your own work on all assignments and programs.  The file ~cs320/calendar will
contain all published deadlines, including occasional extra credit deadlines.

HOW TO SET UP:
While you might have a Scheme compiler on your home machine, I recommend that
you do all your work on edoras; different systems have different behaviors,
and you really don't want to discover that edoras is different at the last
moment.  So, first make the proper directory to hold your .scm file:

edoras% mkdir ~/Three

Then copy the prototype into this directory:

edoras% cp ~cs320/p3.scm ~/Three/p3.scm

WHAT TO PROGRAM:
This p3.scm file already defines some lists with which you can experiment;
all you need to do is add the definition of three functions:
thirds
swap
evenatom

Each of these functions must take exactly one parameter; the parameter should
be a list.  If your function was given the wrong number of parameters, we will
let the interpreter complain about it.  However, if the function is given the
wrong type of parameter (i.e., not a list), the function should return a
friendly error message (including a newline) beginning with 'USAGE:', followed
by an indication of the correct invocation.  For example,
"USAGE: (thirds [list])"

Here is what each function should do [assuming it is given an acceptable
parameter]:

THIRDS:
(thirds lst) should return a new list, formed from taking just the first of
each triple of elements in lst (so, that would be the first, fourth, seventh,
tenth,... elements of the list).  That is, 
(thirds '(a b c d e f g h))
should return:
(a d g)

(thirds (LIST 's 't 'u 'v 'w 'x 'y 'z))
should return:
(s v y)

(thirds '((a b) c (d e f) g (h i)) )
should return:
((a b) g))

(thirds '())
should return the empty list, etc.

SWAP:
(swap lst) should return a new list, formed by swapping the order of pairs of
elements taken from lst (first with second, third with fourth, etc.).  That is, 
(swap '(a b c d e f g))
should return:
(b a d c f e g)

(swap (LIST 's 't 'u 'v 'w 'x 'y 'z))
should return:
(t s v u x w z y)

(swap '((h i) (j k) l (m n o)))
should return:
((j k) (h i) (m n o) l)

Both (swap '()) and (swap '(a))
should return the list unchanged, since there is no pair to swap.

EVENATOM:
(evenatom lst) should return #t if the list lst contains an even number of
atoms, and return #f otherwise.
That is,
(evenatom '((h i) (j k) l (m n o)))
should return:
#t
...since there were 8 total atoms in the four-element list lst, and 8 is even.

(evenatom (LIST 'a 'b 'c 'd 'e 'f 'g))
should return:
#f
...since 7 is not even.

(evenatom '())
should return true, since zero is even (it's divisible by 2, with no remainder).

For extra credit [extra-extra credit if you meet the early deadline], you
can create a rswap function that behaves like a recursive version of swap.
That is, it behaves the same as swap if the list is made up entirely of
atoms, but if there are sublists, then those sublists get swapped around
as well.  For example,

(rswap '((h i) (j k) l (m n o)) )
should return:
((k j) (i h) (n m o) l)
and 
(rswap '((a b) c (d (e f)) g (h i)) )
should return:
(c (b a) g ((f e) d) (i h))

If you forget a closing parenthesis, your functions will not work (you'll
get a 'premature EOF' error).  It's critical that you use an editor that will
match up parentheses, since there are so many of them in LISP-like languages.
In vi, for example, if you navigate your cursor over a parenthesis and then
type the '%' character, the vi cursor will jump to the matching parenthesis.
If the cursor doesn't move, then you know you have a mismatch.  (In vi,
'%' causes the same trick to happen with {} and [], too.)

To start scheme and get it to pay attention to your definitions, you would do:
scheme --load p3.scm
...and then type commands at it (much like you did with the APL interpreter).
[scheme, like most UNIX utilities, exits when it sees EOF, so typing a Control-D
is the graceful way to quit scheme.]

GRADING CONSIDERATIONS:
The most important thing to remember is that you must provide me with a
functional programming solution in order to get any credit.  Even though
the variant of Scheme on edoras allows constants to be redefined (an example
of this is shown in ~cs320/schemetutorial.scm), you must NOT store values;
therefore, all three of your functions must be defined recursively [Chapter 15
of Sebesta shows many such 'legal' scheme functions of this type].

It is OK to define 'helper' functions if you find that convenient (for example,
facthelper was a helper function for factorial on Page 679).

Your program will be checked against some predefined lists (you'll find
these are already DEFINEd in ~cs320/p3.scm for you) as well as some new lists
that the autograder will make up.  The autograder will periodically conduct
tests on your ~/Three/p3.scm file and mail you feedback.  However, it won't
attempt to do anything unless you have [at least] defined the 'thirds' function.
So, put a syntactically correct definition of the thirds function into your
~/Three/p3.scm file early on [it doesn't have to work correctly; it merely
has to exist and be 'legal' scheme code], or else you won't really have
much of a clue as to what sort of tests I will be running.

Refer to the documentation guidelines advertised in our first C program;
most of those suggestions are applicable here (no extraneous prompts; explain
your algorithm; point out any failures to meet the specs; give credit when
you borrow code from other sources; etc.)

WHAT TO HAND IN:
Nothing!  Your program will be automatically collected, tested, and printed for
you.  However: Make SURE that the directory is named Three [the capitalization
must be exact] and the file is named p3.scm, otherwise the program which
automatically interprets it and runs it on the test data will not be
able to find it (which would be a Very Bad Thing, earning you ZERO points
for the program).  Do not change the default permissions on the files;
they must remain unreadable to 'group' and 'other'.  Make a copy of
the directory and its contents if you wish to do further experimentation
with the program after the due date; leave the original untouched until
you receive a grade with which you are satisfied.

The autograder will collect your program, interpret your definitions,
and perform some tests on it.  The autograder can only assign a partial
numerical grade; a human (me) will have to look over the quality of your
comments, ensure that you are actually doing functional programming [that
means NOT using variables; you can't get ANY credit if you try to use
scheme as an imperative language, even if your functions produce the correct
answers].  After I check all those things, I'll assign a grade, and eventually
I'll return the printouts to you in class, along with handwritten comments.

EXTRA CREDIT:
The file called ~/Three/GradeEarly (note the odd capitalization) is intended
to signal that you have completed the project a week early, and wish to
take advantage of the extra credit reward.  The contents of the file are
immaterial; the autograder will only test for the existence of this file.
If the file has been created by the 120% deadline, your project will be
picked up for grading at that time (so no further changes to your code or
documentation will be possible).  Your score will be augmented by 20% (for
example, if you would have normally received 80% of the points, you will
instead qualify for 96% of the points possible).
